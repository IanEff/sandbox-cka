# Helm Release Fix

A Helm release `metrics-app` in namespace `helm-ns` is in a failed state.

Investigate and fix the release so the application deploys successfully.

**Constraints:**
- The release name must remain `metrics-app`.
- The namespace must remain `helm-ns`.
- Use Helm to fix the issue (do not manually create resources).
