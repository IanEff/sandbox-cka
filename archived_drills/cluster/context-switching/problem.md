# Context Switching Challenge

A new context named `restricted` has been created in your kubeconfig.

1. Switch to the `restricted` context.
2. Verify you can list pods in the `default` namespace.
3. Try to list nodes (you should be denied).

**Goal:** Ensure your current context is set to `restricted`.
