# CRD Confusion

A Custom Resource Definition (CRD) named `widgets.example.com` has been installed.
Developers are struggling to create valid instances of this resource.

**Tasks:**
1.  Inspect the CRD to understand its schema.
2.  Create a `Widget` instance named `spinner` in the `default` namespace.
3.  Set the `spec` as follows:
    *   `speed`: 100
    *   `color`: "blue"
