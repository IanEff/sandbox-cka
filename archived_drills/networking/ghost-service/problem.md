# Drill: Ghost Service

The Service `phantom` in namespace `haunted` is supposed to expose the `spirit` deployment.
However, when you check the Endpoints, it's empty!

**Your Task:**
Fix the Service selector so that it correctly finds the `spirit` pods.
Do not modify the pods or deployment labels; you must fix the Service.
