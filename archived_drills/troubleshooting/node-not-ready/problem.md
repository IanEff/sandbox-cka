# Node Not Ready

A worker node in the cluster is showing status `NotReady`.

Applications scheduled to that node are not functioning properly.

**Your Task:**
Identify why the node is not ready and restore it to `Ready` status.

**Constraints:**
- Do not delete or recreate the node.
- The fix must persist (node should stay Ready).
