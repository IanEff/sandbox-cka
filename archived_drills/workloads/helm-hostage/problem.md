# Helm Hostage

The development team attempted to deploy their application using Helm, but it's not coming up.

A release named `broken-app` has been deployed in the `default` namespace.
The application should be running the `nginx:alpine` image.

**Tasks:**
1.  Investigate why the `broken-app` release is failing.
2.  Upgrade the release to fix the issue.
3.  Ensure the pod is in a `Running` state.
