# Tactic - Time management tactics

- **Do the fast wins first**: create objects, fix obvious selector typos, simple RBAC.
- **Park hard problems** after ~6–8 minutes:
  - Write down what you tried in a scratch buffer.
  - Move on and come back with fresh eyes.
- **Validate in the simplest way**:
  - If it’s [[Topic - Networking|networking]]: `endpoints`, then `port-forward`, then in-cluster curl.
  - If it’s scheduling: events + taints.
  - If it’s [[Topic - Storage|storage]]: PVC events + SC.
